## HomeWork 4

Here is the [link](https://github.com/Maria815/STAT545-hw-Guo-Maria/blob/master/hw4/hw04.md) to my homework.

In this homework, I reshaped data from gapminder and join two data frame by using various join functions. During the process, I found it is quite challenging to apply the right function to make clear table for data reshaping. Making a second data frame is also a hard time for me as I want to have short and clear table after joining that shows both added and not matched data (ie. N/A)
